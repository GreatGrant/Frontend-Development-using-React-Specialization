#Developing Responsive Web Pages Using HTML5 and CSS3

The number of mobile users has increased exponentially over the past few years. Shopping, social connect, entertainment and other activities are just a few clicks away for these mobile users.  A responsive web design adjusts the layout and appearance of the web pages to suit the resolution and width of the screens. This makes a web page look attractive on devices with diverse screen sizes. Designing a well-organized, responsive, and user-friendly web page has therefore become the need of the hour. 
This course will guide you to develop websites that adapt to the device size of the visitorâ€™s viewport and provide users an optimal experience.
